Binary (pre-compiled) wallets are available on all platforms at [http://vergecurrency.com](http://vergecurrency.com/#wallets-top)


Compiling Linux Wallet on Ubuntu
----------------------

If you have never compiled a wallet in linux before, here are the dependencies you will need:

```
 sudo add-apt-repository ppa:bitcoin/bitcoin
 sudo apt-get update
 sudo apt-get install libdb4.8-dev libdb4.8++-dev build-essential libtool autotools-dev automake pkg-config libssl-dev libevent-dev bsdmainutils git libboost-all-dev libminiupnpc-dev libqt5gui5 libqt5core5a libqt5webkit5-dev libqt5dbus5 qttools5-dev qttools5-dev-tools libprotobuf-dev protobuf-compiler libqrencode-dev
```

To clone the git repository and compile the daemon and gui wallet:

    git clone https://github.com/vergecurrency/verge && cd verge && ./autogen.sh && ./configure && make

The gui wallet is in ./verge/src/qt and the daemon in ./verge/src directories.

> Note: If you see something like 'Killed (program cc1plus)' run 'dmesg' to see the error(s)/problems(s). This is most likely caused by running out of resources. You may need to add some RAM or add some swap space.

Optional:
If you want to copy the binaries for use by all users, run the following commands:

    sudo cp src/VERGEd /usr/bin/
    sudo cp src/qt/VERGE-qt /usr/bin/

After that has been done, type cd ~/ to get back to the home folder and type:

    ./VERGEd

this will tell you that you need to make a VERGE.conf and some good starting values.

Create a new configuration file:
 
    nano ~/.VERGE/VERGE.conf
    
Paste the output from the `VERGEd` command into the VERGE.conf like this: (It is recommended to change the password.)

    rpcuser=vergerpcusername
    rpcpassword=85CpSuCNvDcYsdQU8w621mkQqJAimSQwCSJL5dPT9wQX
    
    
Once that has been completed proceed to add `rpcport=20102 port=21102 and daemon=1` below the rpcpassword. your config should look something like this

    rpcuser=vergerpcusername
    rpcpassword=85CpSuCNvDcYsdQU8w621mkQqJAimSQwCSJL5dPT9wQX
    rpcport=20102
    port=21102
    daemon=1

Exit the VERGE.conf by pressing `ctrl + x` on your keyboard then pressing `y` and hitting enter. This should have made your .conf save with all the stuff you just added. If you wish you can check again by typing `nano ~/.VERGE/VERGE.conf`. After you've checked then exit the file the exact same way, then type `cd ~` as before i said this takes you back to your home folder, you can now type verged and your verge daemon should start.

To check the status of how much of the blockchain has been downloaded (aka synced) type `verged getinfo`.



To compile on Mac (OSX El Capitan):
------------
    brew install protobuf boost miniupnpc openssl qt5 qrencode berkeley-db4
    brew link --force qt5
    git clone https://github.com/vergecurrency/verge
    cd verge
    ./autogen.sh
    ./configure
    make -j4


Want to use Docker?
------------

Check out the [readme](https://github.com/vergecurrency/VERGE/tree/master/contrib/docker) for more information.

Using different algorithms (for mining)
----------

To use a specific mining algorithm use the `algo` switch in your configuration file (.conf file) or from the command line (like this `--algo=x17`) Here are the possible values:

    algo=x17
    algo=scrypt
    algo=groestl
    algo=lyra
    algo=blake

Using VERGE on Windows
-------------

1. Download the pre-compiled software. (only from official VERGE site)
2. Install
3. In windows file explorer, open c:\Users\XXX\AppData\Roaming\VERGE (be sure to change XXX to your windows user)
4. Right click and create a new file verge.txt
5. Edit the file to have contents above (see Linux instructions)
6. Save and close the file
7. Reame the file to verge.conf
8. Start the VERGE-qt program.
9. Open up VERGE-qt console and run 'getinfo' (or 'getmininginfo') to verify settings from conf file

> Note: You must re-start VERGE-qt after making changes to verge.conf.
