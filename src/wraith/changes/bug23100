  o Minor bugfixes (Performance):
    - Use hidden service circuits (and other circuits longer than 3 hops)
      to calculate a circuit build timeout. Previously, Tor only calculated
      its build timeout based on circuits that planned to be exactly 3 hops
      long. With this change, we include measurements from all circuits at
      the point where they complete their third hop.  Fixes bug 23100;
      bugfix on 0.2.2.2-alpha.
