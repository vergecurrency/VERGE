  o Major feature (channel):
    - Remove the incoming and outgoing channel queues. The reason to do so was
      due to the fact that they were always empty meaning never used but still
      looked at in our fast path. Bottom line, it was an unused code path.
    - We've simplify a lot the channel subsystem by removing those queues but
      also by removing a lot of unused code or dead code around it. Overall
      this is a cleanup removing more than 1500 lines of code overall and
      adding very little except for unit test.
    - The majority ot the channel unit tests have been rewritten and the code
      coverage has now been raised to 83.6% for channel.c.
      Closes ticket 23709.
