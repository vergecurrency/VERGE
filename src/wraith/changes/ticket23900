  o Minor features (API, embedding):
    - Tor can now start with a preauthenticated control connection
      created by the process that launched it. This feature is meant
      for use by programs that want to launch and manage a Tor process
      without allowing other programs to manage it as well.
      For more information, see the __OwningControllerFD option
      documented in control-spec.txt. Closes ticket 23900.
