  o Minor bugfixes (Performance):
    - Consider circuits for timeout as soon as they complete a hop. This
      is more accurate than applying the timeout in circuit_expire_building()
      because that function is only called once per second, which is now
      too slow for typical timeouts on the current network. Fixes bug 23114;
      bugfix on 0.2.2.2-alpha.
