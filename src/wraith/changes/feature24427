  o Minor features (OSX, iOS, performance):
    - Use the mach_approximate_time() function (when available) to
      implement coarse monotonic time. Having a coarse time function
      should avoid a large number of system calls, and improve
      performance slightly, especially under load. Closes ticket 24427.
