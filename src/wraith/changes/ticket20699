  o Major features (hidden service v3, control port):
    - Control port now supports command and events for hidden service v3. See
      proposal 284 for more information on what has been done exactly. Only
      the HSFETCH command hasn't been implemented at this stage because of a
      lack of use case with v3.

      It is now possible to create ephemeral v3 services using the ADD_ONION
      command. Here is a summary of the events and commands that have been
      modified to support v3:
      
        Events: HS_DESC, HS_DESC_CONTENT, CIRC and CIRC_MINOR The
        Commands: GETINFO, HSPOST, ADD_ONION and DEL_ONION.

      This closes ticket 20699.
