  o Minor features (defensive programming):
    - Most of the functions in Tor that free objects have been replaced
      with macros that free the objects and set the corresponding pointers
      to NULL. This change should help prevent a large class of dangling
      pointer bugs. Closes ticket 24337.

    - Where possible, the tor_free() macro now only evaluates its input once.
      Part of ticket 24337.
