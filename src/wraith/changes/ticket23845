  o Major features (embedding):
    - There is now a documented stable API for programs that need to
      embed Tor. See tor_api.h for full documentation and known bugs.
      Closes ticket 23684.

  o Code simplification and refactoring:
    - The tor_git_revision[] constant no longer needs to be redeclared
      by everything that links against the rest of Tor.  Done as part
      of ticket 23845, to simplify our external API.
