  o Major features (storage):
    - Users can choose to store cached directory documents somewhere other
      than the DataDirectory by using the CacheDirectory option.
      Similarly, the storage location for relay's keys can be overridden
      with the KeyDirectory option.
      Closes ticket 22703.
